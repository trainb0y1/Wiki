# Power Armor
Power Armor is a specialized type of armor that can grant the player special abilities, through the use of modules.

### Crafting
Each armor piece is crafted using titanium ingots and size G batteries.

## Armor Modules
Armor modules are the core of what makes power armor different from the vanilla armors. Each one grants the player a special ability, at the cost of power.
#### Adding and Removing Modules
Modules can be added and removed through the Power Armor GUI, accessible through `/powerarmor`by placing them in the empty slots to the left of the screen.


#### Module Weight
Each module has a weight value, and if the player adds too many modules, the combined weight will exceed the maximum of (INSERT MAX)
If this occurs, the modules will all disable.

The current weight is visible by hovering over the line of panes down the center of the GUI. It will be red if the weight exceeds the maximum, or green otherwise.

## Armor Power
Armor power is considered to be the sum of the powers of each of the armor pieces. Power is drained from the helmet, then the chestplate, then the leggings, and finally the boots. 

 Charging the armor items charges the set's power.

The power indicator shows the current armor power, and changes color depending on the power percentage.

In addition to charging the individual items, power can be added by placing batteries, or any other powerable item, into the slot below the power indicator. The power will be transferred from the item to the armor.
