## Armor Power
Armor power is considered to be the sum of the powers of each of the armor pieces. Power is drained from the helmet, then the chestplate, then the leggings, and finally the boots. 

 Charging the armor items charges the set's power.

The power indicator shows the current armor power, and changes color depending on the power percentage.

In addition to charging the individual items, power can be added by placing batteries, or any other powerable item, into the slot below the power indicator. The power will be transferred from the item to the armor.
